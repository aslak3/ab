v0.1 Unknown date

      * Test version.

v1.0 7-11-95

      * First release (on my web page)

v1.0a 21-11-95, 28-11-95, 3-12-95, 18-12-95

      * Major bug in search function fixed.  It resulted in an accidental
        change of search type.  Picard reported strange things when
        searching.
      * Added command line support, you can now load an AB file on 
        startup.
      * Added default tool and shift-clicking to wbmain().  Only works on
        AB files which are in the same dir as program.  Need to fix this!

v1.0b 12-1-96, 13-1-96, 20-1-96, 22-1-96

      * Added printer support at last!  Pretty basic still, but useful.
      * Rearranged GUI layout slightly.  Made the address details in the
        entry_node into an array of 5 string pointers.
      * Added tone dialling.  Tested as a stand alone program, but is un-
        tested in AB.  Rearranged gadget layout again to incorporate the
        dial gadget.
      * Added tooltypes to make tone dialling times configurable.  Fixed
        Workbench startup.  Now accepts project icons in any directory.

v1.1 22-1-96

      * New release on web page.

v1.1a 25-1-96, 31-1-96

      * General tweaking.
      * Added the quit message requester.  If changes have been made 
        since the last save, then a warning requester will appear.

v1.1b 4-2-96, 6-2-96, 10-2-96

      * GUI is now font sensitive.  Doesn't check that window will fit on
        screen though.
      * Added an ARexx port!  Command parser is a bit primitive, but it
        works.  15 commands are supported.
      * Added ARexx command list and an example script to the
        documentation.

v1.1c 24-2-95, 28-2-96

      * At the request of Philip Reyntens, printing has been improved so
        that blank fields are no longer printed.  Also added two more
        commands: NEW_ENTRY and PUT_ENTRY_DETAILS.  These two commands
        make it possible to add new entries from with an ARexx script.
      * Added the two new commands to the documentation.

v1.1d 5-3-96, 6-3-96, 7-3-96, 9-3-96

      * Added Public Screen support.  It appears that some programs
        which open public screens (namely MUI and Memacs) do not close
        their public screens when the last visitor window screen has left.
        Not sure if this is correct behavior yet.
      * Added a Zoom gadget to AB's main window.
      * Added Print Headings? and Print All? menu items, as well as their
        respective tooltypes.  Also reorganised the way that default
        settings are stored.
      * Made Tooltype saving better, and also made it so you can clear a
        field with the PUT_ENTRY_DETAILS command.  Updated documentation.

v1.1e 12-3-96, 13-3-96, 16-3-96, 23-3-96

      * Added HIDE and SHOW ARexx commands.
      * Added commodity support.
      * Added Amiga-F shortcut for Search function.  Wow.
      * Improved commodity support.  Fixed potentioal bug in
        close_commodity, and added code to properly detect for duplicate
        copies of AB being run together.

v1.2 26-3-96, 28-3-96, 29-3-96

      * New release on web page.
      * Problems in documentation.  Fixed them.
      * Changed the main window updating code so that the Dial button is
        only active when the current entry contains a phone number.  Also
        added in new command, DIAL_NUMBER which dials the number specified
        in its argument.  Added command description to documentation.  Now
        detects an illegal hotkey, but does nothing about it.

1.2a 14-5-96, 13-8-96, 10-9-96, 13-9-96, 17-9-96, 22-11-96

      * Chris Davis requested two things: AB should run on OS2.0, and AB
        should have a tooltype to set the window width.  This version has
        these two things added.  Compatability with OS2.0 is untested
        however.  He requested other things, but they will have to wait
        till later.
      * v2.0 compatibility still not tested.  Removed need for
        NO_OF_AREXX_COMMANDS.
      * The window title now shows the number of the currently viewed
        entry and the number of entries in the project.  The four
        movement buttons have been replaced with a single scroll bar.
      * Added keyboard shortcuts for gadgets.
      * Internal changes and made it so entries are sorted by surname.
        Fixed two bugs which have been in the program since the start.
        Both bugs were to do with access to memory not owned by the
        program.
      * BenB requested that cursor keys be used to move through records
        instead of . and ,.  Did this

1.2b 6-4-97

      * Chris Davis reported that AB didn't run under 2.0, so I have
        given up in getting it to run on the older OS for now.  Also he
        asked me to add in the OLD_SORTING tooltype which I have done.
